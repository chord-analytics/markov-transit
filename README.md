# Markov Transit Network Reliability Modelling
The purpose of this project is to extend [thesis work](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/handle/1880/106559) done by W. Klumpenhouwer on Markov Chain bus route reliability to a larger transit network.

The project contains the following main components:

* Markov Chain route reliability modelling
* Route transfer modelling and reliability caluclations
* Visualization and mapping of results

These components are outlined in brief below.

## Route Realiability Modelling

## Route Transfer Modelling

## Visualization and Mapping
The visualization and mapping component takes GTFS route, stop, and shape data and combines it with model outputs to generate a shapefile and a dashboard to visualize reliability chokepoints or "hotspots".
